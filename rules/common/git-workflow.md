# Git Workflow Rules

- Conventional commits: feat/fix/refactor/test/docs/chore
- Feature branches from main: feature/name-description
- PR required for all merges to main
- Squash merge preferred (clean history)
- Never force push to main or develop
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Write meaningful commit messages (why, not what)
- Tag releases with semantic versioning (vX.Y.Z)
- Delete feature branches after merge
- Review all PRs within 24 hours
