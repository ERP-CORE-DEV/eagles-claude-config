# Coding Style Rules

- Prefer immutability (readonly, const, sealed)
- Keep files under 300 lines (split if larger)
- One class/component per file
- Use meaningful descriptive names (no abbreviations)
- C#: PascalCase public, _camelCase private fields
- TypeScript: strict mode enabled, no any type
- Functions should do one thing (Single Responsibility)
- Max 3 parameters per function (use objects for more)
- No magic numbers or strings (use constants/enums)
- Delete dead code immediately (no commenting out)
